# California-Public-Transit-Usage-Tableau-Dashboards

Problem statement:

The California Public Transit System is currently facing an significant issue of meeting ridership demand as current prices for gasoline, diesel have made it unaffordable for many americans living near the city to continue using their cars daily as their primary mode of transport daily. Therefore, a significant number of Americans are estimated to shift to public transport as their primary mode of transport. The State has decided to initate an analytics project to modify public transport frequency to match current levels of demand.


Objective: Create visualization dashboards identifying current public transportation trends and patterns for the Head of California State Transportation Agency to deploy and modify State resources for the purposes of diagnostic analytics to cope with the current situation.

Steps taken:

Step 1= Load data into Tableau Desktop, large-sized datasets are csv files. 
Step 2= Perform data cleaning & validation if required on the data source tab of Tableau Desktop. 
Step 3= Creation of two visualization dashboards optimised for desktop view for diagnostic analytics purposes.
