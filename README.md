# California-Public-Transit-Usage-Tableau-Dashboards

Problem statement:

The California Public Transit System is currently facing an significant issue of meeting ridership demand as current prices for gasoline, diesel have made it unaffordable for many americans living near the city to continue using their cars daily as their primary mode of transport daily. Therefore, a significant number of Americans are estimated to shift to public transport as their primary mode of transport. The State has decided to initate an analytics project to modify public transport frequency to match current levels of demand.


Objective: Create visualization dashboards identifying current public transporttation trends and patterns for the Head of California State Transportation Agency to deploy and modify State resources for the purposes of diagnostic analytics to cope with the current situation.

Steps taken:


Data Cleaning and Validation were done on the dataset when required and imported into Tableau.

Relevant Data Visualizations were made in an easily understandable manner for the purpose of diagnostic analytics that will be very useful for company executives who are examining the salary packages of existing employees and whether the company is expanding its workforce fast enough to capitalize on growth opportunities in the industry they are in.
